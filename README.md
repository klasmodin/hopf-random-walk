# Two challenge problems for horizontal Brownian motion of the Hopf fibration

In [this notebook](hopf-random-walk.ipynb) we set forth a challenge problem for the 
[Math in the Black Forest](https://www.stochastik.uni-freiburg.de/professoren/philipp-harms/shapeworkshop) workshop.
The notebook also serves as an introduction to the Hopf fibration, the simulation of stochastic flows, and the geometry associated with Riemannian submersions. 
The original motivation comes from a corresponding (much more complicated) infinite-dimensional problem, related to stochastic gradient flows on shape space.

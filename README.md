# Two challenge problems for horizontal Brownian motion of the Hopf fibration

In [this notebook](hopf-random-walk.ipynb) we set forth a challenge problem for the 
[Math in the Black Forest](https://www.stochastik.uni-freiburg.de/professoren/philipp-harms/shapeworkshop) workshop.
The notebook also serves as an introduction to the Hopf fibration, the simulation of stochastic flows, and the geometry associated with Riemannian submersions. A nice little animation for the non-uniform and uniform random walks is [available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmodin/hopf-random-walk/master/double-walk.mp4).

The original motivation comes from a corresponding (much more complicated) infinite-dimensional problem, related to stochastic gradient flows on shape space.
